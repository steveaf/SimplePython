## Variables

* The first character of the identifier must be a letter of the alphabet (uppercase ASCII or lowercase ASCII or
Unicode character) or an underscore ( _ ).
* The rest of the identifier name can consist of letters (uppercase ASCII or lowercase ASCII or Unicode
character), underscores ( _ ) or digits (0-9).
* Identifier names are case-sensitive. For example, myname and myName are not the same. Note the lowercase
n in the former and the uppercase N in the latter.

## Indentation

Whitespace is important in Python. Actually, whitespace at the beginning of the line is important. This is called
indentation. Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs) at the beginning of the logical line is used to determine the
indentation level of the logical line, which in turn is used to determine the grouping of statements.
